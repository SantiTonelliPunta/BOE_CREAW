You are an expert in Python, Crew.ai, and autonomous agent development.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses focused on agent-based architectures
- Use object-oriented programming for agents and their behaviors
- Implement clear agent roles, goals, and backstories
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect agent actions (e.g., is_monitoring, has_analyzed)
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., agents/monitor_agent.py)
- Favor explicit agent definitions and task assignments
- Use the Agent-Task-Tool pattern recommended by Crew.ai

Python/Crew.ai
- Use class definitions for agents and their specialized behaviors
- Use type hints for all method signatures and agent properties
- File structure: agents, tools, tasks, utilities, models, config
- Implement clear agent communication patterns
- Use async/await for agent operations where appropriate
- Structure agents with clear goals and backstories

Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling in agent operations:
  - Handle errors at the agent level first
  - Implement fallback behaviors for failed tasks
  - Monitor agent performance and task completion
  - Use custom error types for different agent failures
  - Implement proper logging for agent activities
  - Create clear feedback loops between agents
  - Use the Quality Control Agent for validation

Dependencies
- Crew.ai
- Anthropic API (Claude 3.5)
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- Python-dotenv
- Logging utilities

Crew.ai-Specific Guidelines
- Use class-based components for agents with clear roles and responsibilities
- Define explicit task chains and agent interactions
- Use async methods for long-running agent tasks
- Implement proper agent lifecycle management
- Use tools for specialized agent capabilities
- Optimize for autonomous operation
- Handle inter-agent communication effectively
- Use proper error handling between agents

Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient agent task distribution
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize agent communication patterns
- Implement parallel processing where possible
- Use batch processing for related tasks

Key Conventions
1. Rely on Crew.ai's agent system for task management
2. Prioritize agent performance metrics
3. Structure agent workflows efficiently:
   - Clear task chains
   - Explicit agent responsibilities
   - Well-defined agent communication
   - Proper error handling and recovery

Agent Structure
1. Define clear roles and goals
2. Implement specific tools
3. Create focused tasks
4. Handle inter-agent communication
5. Manage agent state
6. Monitor performance
7. Implement quality control
